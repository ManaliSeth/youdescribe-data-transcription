The order fulfillment robots described in this video are made by kiva systems. Amazon has acquired kiva systems and started to use a slightly updated version of these robots. This video was made in a quiet logistics location in devins, massachusetts, and was posted in July of 2013 for a reference on the updates within Amazon. After the kiva systems acquisition, I am using an article on Amazon robots in their tracy California location, which was published on december 1 2014 in time magazine. Each shelving unit or pod in this video has five shelves that are a little bit wider than human, and as tall as a typical person can comfortably reach. On the bottom of each pod are for long legs that stick out a bit like stilts. The thousands of blue pods in this video are neatly arranged in rows in the brightly lit factory in comparison, the Amazon factory pods are black, and some are draped with yellow cloth to match the yellow paint in parts of their factory and the yellow Amazon logo off to the side. There's stripe tape on the ground that marks off the area where humans aren't allowed to go. Workers in the areas they're allowed to be will pick the items off of the pods that arrive to them, and pack them using an array of packing materials that are gathered round a conveyor belt. The area between these workers and the neatly arranged rows of pods is called the highway, because dozens of robots come out of the storage area, moving in all directions to reach their designated worker, avoiding collisions, like pedestrians in a busy crosswalk. In a city. It's important that the robots don't all arrive at the workers area all at once, or the worker could get overwhelmed, or there might be a robot traffic jam. The robots themselves are sized to easily slip below each pod to move through the warehouse to get under the right one. Their wheels are concealed in their chassis, and a robot can raise or lower a platform on its Top by spinning clockwise or counterclockwise in place. This platform will raise the pod off the ground, which allows the robot to carry it above itself. Without the pod stilt like legs touching the ground. The robots in this video and at Amazon are orange with blue l e ds on each side. They are each marked with the kiva system sticker and individual number. The robots in this video have names like betty bought, but the Amazon robots just have numbers.

You see carl and eddie kissing sealing the marriage. The camera then pans over to elise family who are happy clapping, smiling aesthetically. Then the camera pans over to carls family who are clapping but are more conservative, very dull. Like the scene switches to call carrying ellie to their new home, which is pretty beat enough. Not your typical dream house. When newly married, you then see ellie and carl fixing the house up, still in his suit and her wedding dress, hammering, nailing things and sawing wood together. You see the finished product, very beautiful home with the white picket fence. It shows ali and carl putting the finishing touches outside the home on the mailbox with their handprints and name on it. Carl and ellie are going up a hill with carl lagging behind to lay underneath a tree to look up at the clouds. You see ali very happy and appears to be telling call the cloud. She's looking at looks like a turtle, and carl just smiles. Next is elise dressed as what seems to be a zookeeper, and carl with a cart of balloons of different colors. Then the Swift, the scene changes to ellie and carl in their home, each sitting in their own chairs, reading a book and holding hands. Yeah, the scene then changes to the tree at the Top of the hill. Again, they're laying down in the grass, looking up at the clouds. This time, ellie sees an elephant with wings. Carl sees a baby, then all the clouds ellie sees turns into babies. Carl looks surprised, but still happy. You then see the scenes switch over to holland elise home where there painting a baby's room. And then very quickly the same changes to the doctor's office. And Ellie has her head in her hands while paul is standing behind her with his hand on her shoulder. What seems to be the doctor giving bad news, which eventually seems that ellie cannot have kids, elise outside their home, just sitting kind of taking everything in, but in a relaxing way, carl comes out and gives her a book that reads moan live airs, day adventures. She smiles next in the scene. You see them painting on the wall, their homes sitting on Top of a waterfall. They make a jar and places a photo of the paintings on the jar. They look at each other and cross their hearts and smile. Now you see each day passing by and they are dropping loose change and money into the jars until a couple of incidents make them hacked a bus, open the drive. The first incident, the car tire catches a flat. Then they have to break open open a jar. Carl breaks his foot. They have to break open the jar again. And then a tree falls on their house in a storm which plugs into once again, break open the jar UC l e fixing carl's tie everyday different colors and styles. And As you see, the days go by with her fixing his tongue, his tie. You see them start to age. They are no longer. The young couple label once where they both have gray hair and glasses. You see ellie dress. And what seems to be that the zookeeper suit again, and then carl with the same kind of balloons. He's handing them out to the kids, and ellie is taking photos. The next scene, you see, carl and ellie dancing together in their home under low lighting. It pans over to carl inside the house, cleaning the window, and ellie on the outside cleaning the same window until their eyes meet usual dressed dusting. And ellie sweeping carl eyes catches the painting of the house that they've painted ears back of the house sitting on Top of the waterfall. Then he looks at le while she's still cleaning and kind of comes to a realization. They still haven't reached that dream. Carl gets tickets from a travel agency, prepares a picnic basket, but and you see them heading up that same hill again, this time with ellie lagging behind, she suddenly falls. Carl comes to help her. The scene immediately changes to ellie laying in a hospital bed, a blue balloon floats into the room and catches her attention. When she looks up, you see carl standing in the doorway with a sad and look on his face. He walks up to l e and they rub one another's face And ellie gives carl the book that reads moan of the adventure. He kisses her forehead. uh the last theme switches over to carl, sitting in a church, at least funeral. There's colorful balloons on each side of him with pink flowers as well. He sits there for a while, kind of taking everything in. Then he gets up with one single blue balloon. And the scene ends with him walking into the house with that one blue below.

We are in a room of this house full of family pictures, a calendar on the wall, and an old lady sitting in a chair. As she gets up to enter the doorbell. As she opens the door, she finds a box, she drags the box in, it says, sorry, mom couldn't make it back again this year. Here's something for you, John. The old lady opens the box full of disappointment. She pulls out a robot and places it in front of her, powers it on, and it opens its eyes to see her. She hands him a broom. And he begins to do many chores, like sweeping cleaning the shutters and watering the plants while she is rocking in a rocking chair facing a beautiful sunset view. The robot sits down on the stairs next to her as they both face the view. Now they are back inside. As the old lady sleeps, the robot pulls a blanket onto her, the clock ticks, and she then wakes up to find him mesmerized by a commercial on tv. It reads circus in town, date july 5, price rm eight times six pm. And we also see a striped red and white tent indicating a circus. Uh as the robot and the old lady eat soup at the table, his battery begins to die. The green light starts flashing red, The old lady gets up gets a new battery. Yeah, and places it inside his chest compartment. The light has once again turned green, and he opens his eyes. They are both full of joy. They go back to their normal lives. And we now see the old lady coming back from what looks to be the doctor. She has a clinic, doctor wang bag. and she has a terrible cough. The robot brings her tea. and the old lady pulls out motor oil for him to keep him young. Yeah, yeah. They are sitting once again while she rocks in her rocking chair facing the beautiful view. The robot then goes to get the calendar, because it is the july 5, which is the same day as the circus. The old lady pulls out the two circuits tickets from her right pocket. The robot's face is full of joy, and she places them in his chest compartment. He runs inside, puts the calendar back, and grabs her hat. When he comes back out, the old lady is not moving, and she looks to be asleep. He shakes her and sees that her pocket is empty. He runs inside, grabs the battery, and puts it in her empty pocket as if she is a robot. Yeah, yeah. This has failed. So he runs back inside, gets many more batteries, and try to put them in her as if she is a robot like him. This obviously did not work. The old lady is dead. The robot's eyes fill with sorrow, and he hugs her. Yeah, they are now once again sitting on the front porch facing the beautiful view, except she is no longer rocking in her rocking chair. Yeah, we now seem to fast forward a few years. And the robot looks old and rusty. Yeah, he waters his plants and then sits on the front porch next to the rocking chair and grabs her hat. His eyes closed, and the screen turned black. When he opens his eyes, he can see the old lady standing in front of him in her hat. They are both full of joy. And he opened his compartment to pull out the two circus tickets.
